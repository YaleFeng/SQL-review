## SQL Function (Mainly used)

Full version on: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_sqlserver.asp

<ul>
  <li>If (condition, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) - where <em>a</em> is the output if condition is <span style = 'color:red;'>True</span>, <em>b</em> is the output if condition is <span style = 'color:red;'>False</span></li>
  <li>Concat (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, *args) - where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are string</li>
  <li>Substring (value, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) - where <em>a</em> is the index of starting character, <em>b</em> is the length of substring</li>
  <li>Case
    <ul style="list-style-type:none; margin-top:0; padding-top:0;">
      <li>When condition Then result</li>
      <li>Else</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">End</li>
</ul>

## Date Function (Mainly used)

Time: Unit in Hour of Second.

Date: Unit in Day

- Date_format(*time*, *format*)

![Local Image](./dateformat.jpg)

- Datediff(*time1*, *time2*) -> time1 - time2

- Date_add(*time*, INTERVAL *value* *addunit*) -> add exact day/hour/... and return the date, value could be negative

- Day(*time*) / Dayname(*time*) / Dayofmonth(*time*) / Dayofweek(*time*) / Dayofyear(*time*) -> return the day of date

- Month(*time*) / Week(*time*) / Year(*time*) -> return the month/... of the date

- Condition -> *time* <span style = 'color:blue;'>between</span> 'YYYY-MM-DD' <span style = 'color:blue;'>and</span> 'YYYY-MM-DD'

## CTE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set. (Advanced Usage -> Recursive)

```sql
With name1 as (
  query
),
name2 as (
  query
)
select xxx
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recursive CTE, including two parts

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anchor Member (Initial)

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recursive Member (Based on Anchor Member)

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Union All -> connect two parts

**Example:**

```sql
with Recursive CTE as(
  -- Anchor member
  select xxx, 0 as level
  ...
  -- End of Anchor, Union all to connect
  union all
  -- Recursive member
  select xxx, c.level + 1
  from TableX Inner Join CTE c using (id)
)
```

## Window Function

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perform calculation across a set of table rows that related to the current row

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Window function consist:

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Function itself: (Row_number(); Rank(); Sum(); etc)

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Over' clause, define the window or set of rows for functions

```sql
Function_name() Over(Partition By xxx Order By xxx) as New_name
```

- Row_number(): Assigns a unique sequential integer to each row

- Rank(): Assigns a rank to each row

- Dense_rank(): Similar to Rank(), but without gaps in rank values for ties

- Lag(Col, *a*, *b*): Previous *a* row's data, autofill *b* at beginning

**Example**

| SalesPersonID | SaleDate   | Amount | RowNum | Rank | DenseRank | CumulativeSum | RunningAvg | Lag |
|---------------|------------|--------|--------|------|-----------|---------------|------------|-----|
| 1             | 2023-01-01 | 100    | 1      | 3    | 3         | 100           | 100        |  0  |

| 1             | 2023-03-01 | 150    | 3      | 2    | 2         | 450           | 150        | 200 |
| 2             | 2023-01-15 | 300    | 1      | 1    | 1         | 300           | 300        | 150 |
| 2             | 2023-02-15 | 100    | 2      | 2    | 2         | 400           | 200        | 300 |

### Highest Grade For Each Student

**Table: Enrollments**

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| student_id    | int     |
| course_id     | int     |
| grade         | int     |

(student_id, course_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
grade is never NULL.

**Task Description**

Write a solution to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest course_id.

Return the result table ordered by student_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

Enrollments table:

| student_id | course_id | grade |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |

**Output:**

| student_id | course_id | grade |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |

**Explanation:** For each student, the course with the highest grade is selected. In case of a tie in grades, the course with the smallest course_id is chosen. The result is ordered by student_id in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT student_id, MIN(course_id) AS course_id, grade
FROM Enrollments
WHERE (student_id, grade) IN
(
    SELECT student_id, MAX(grade)
    FROM Enrollments
    GROUP BY student_id
)
GROUP BY student_id
ORDER BY student_id ASC
```

### Evaluate Boolean Expression

**Table: Variables**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| name        | varchar |
| value       | int     |

In SQL, `name` is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the stored variables and their values.

**Table: Expressions**

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| left_operand  | varchar |
| operator      | enum    |
| right_operand | varchar |

In SQL, `(left_operand, operator, right_operand)` is the primary key for this table.
This table contains a boolean expression that should be evaluated.
`operator` is an enum that takes one of the values ('<', '>', '=')
The values of `left_operand` and `right_operand` are guaranteed to be in the Variables table.

**Task Description**

Evaluate the boolean expressions in the Expressions table.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

Variables table:

| name | value |
|------|-------|
| x    | 66    |
| y    | 77    |

Expressions table:

| left_operand | operator | right_operand |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| x            | >        | y             |
| x            | <        | y             |
| x            | =        | y             |
| y            | >        | x             |
| y            | <        | x             |
| x            | =        | x             |

**Output:**

| left_operand | operator | right_operand | value |
|--------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| x            | >        | y             | false |
| x            | <        | y             | true  |
| x            | =        | y             | false |
| y            | >        | x             | true  |
| y            | <        | x             | false |
| x            | =        | x             | true  |

**Explanation:** As shown, you need to find the value of each boolean expression in the table using the Variables table.

```sql
select e.left_operand, e.operator, e.right_operand, (
    case
        when e.operator = '<' and v1.value < v2.value then 'true'
        when e.operator = '=' and v1.value = v2.value then 'true'
        when e.operator = '>' and v1.value > v2.value then 'true'
        else 'false'
    end
) as value  
from Expressions e
join Variables v1
on v1.name = e.left_operand
join Variables v2
on v2.name = e.right_operand
```

### Team Scores in Football Tournament

**Table: Teams**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| team_id     | int     |
| team_name   | varchar |

`team_id` is the column with unique values of this table.
Each row of this table represents a single football team.

**Table: Matches**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| match_id    | int     |
| host_team   | int     |
| guest_team  | int     |
| host_goals  | int     |
| guest_goals | int     |

`match_id` is the column with unique values of this table.
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams.
Teams `host_team` and `guest_team` are represented by their IDs in the Teams table (`team_id`), and they scored `host_goals` and `guest_goals` goals, respectively.

**Task Description**

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:
- A team receives three points if they win a match (i.e., scored more goals than the opponent team).
- A team receives one point if they draw a match (i.e., scored the same number of goals as the opponent team).
- A team receives no points if they lose a match (i.e., scored fewer goals than the opponent team).

Write a solution that selects the `team_id`, `team_name` and `num_points` of each team in the tournament after all described matches.

Return the result table ordered by `num_points` in decreasing order. In case of a tie, order the records by `team_id` in increasing order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

Teams table:

| team_id | team_name   |
|---------|-------------|
| 10      | Leetcode FC |
| 20      | NewYork FC  |
| 30      | Atlanta FC  |
| 40      | Chicago FC  |
| 50      | Toronto FC  |

Matches table:

| match_id | host_team | guest_team | host_goals | guest_goals |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 1        | 10        | 20         | 3          | 0           |
| 2        | 30        | 10         | 2          | 2           |
| 3        | 10        | 50         | 5          | 1           |
| 4        | 20        | 30         | 1          | 0           |
| 5        | 50        | 30         | 1          | 0           |

**Output:**

| team_id | team_name   | num_points |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| 10      | Leetcode FC | 7          |
| 20      | NewYork FC  | 3          |
| 50      | Toronto FC  | 3          |
| 30      | Atlanta FC  | 1          |
| 40      | Chicago FC  | 0          |

**Explanation:** For each team, compute the total points based on the results of their matches. The result table is ordered by `num_points` in decreasing order. In case of a tie, the records are ordered by `team_id` in increasing order.

```sql
with ctd1 as (
    select host_team as team_id, (
        case
            when host_goals > guest_goals then 3
            when host_goals = guest_goals then 1
            else 0
        end
    ) as points
    from Matches m
    join Teams t
    on m.host_team = t.team_id
    union all
    select guest_team as team_id, (
        case
            when host_goals > guest_goals then 0
            when host_goals = guest_goals then 1
            else 3
        end
    ) as points
    from Matches m
    join Teams t
    on m.guest_team = t.team_id

)

select t.team_id, team_name, ifnull(sum(points),0) as num_points
from Teams t
left join ctd1 c
using (team_id)
group by t.team_id
order by num_points desc, t.team_id 
```

**Output:**

| country  |
|----------|
| Peru     |

**Explanation:** 
The average call duration for Peru is (102 + 330 + 5) / 3 = 145.666667
The average call duration for Israel is (33 + 4 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 7) / 7 = 9.428571
The average call duration for Morocco is (59 + 4) / 2 = 31.5 
Global call duration average = (33 + 4 + 59 + 102 + 330 + 5 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 7) / 10 = 55.7
Since Peru is the only country where the average call duration is greater than the global average, it is the only recommended country.

**Explanation:** 
For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.

```sql
select a1.player_id, a1.event_date, sum(a2.games_played) as games_played_so_far
from Activity a1
inner join Activity a2
on a1.event_date >= a2.event_date and a1.player_id = a2.player_id
group by a1.player_id, a1.event_date
```

**Output:**

| user_id | biggest_window |
|---------|----------------|
| 1       | 39             |
| 2       | 65             |
| 3       | 51             |

**Explanation:** 
For the first user, the windows in question are between dates:
- 2020-10-20 and 2020-11-28 with a total of 39 days.
- 2020-11-28 and 2020-12-3 with a total of 5 days.
- 2020-12-3 and 2021-1-1 with a total of 29 days.
Making the biggest window the one with 39 days.

For the second user, the windows in question are between dates:
- 2020-10-5 and 2020-12-9 with a total of 65 days.
- 2020-12-9 and 2021-1-1 with a total of 23 days.
Making the biggest window the one with 65 days.

For the third user, the only window in question is between dates 2020-11-11 and 2021-1-1 with a total of 51 days.

```sql
select user_id, max(date_diff) as biggest_window
from (
    select user_id, visit_date, next_date, DATEDIFF(next_date, visit_date) as date_diff
    from (
        select user_id, visit_date, lag(visit_date, 1, '2021-1-1') over(partition by user_id order by visit_date desc) as next_date
        from UserVisits
    ) as temp1
) as temp
group by user_id
```

### Report Contiguous Dates

**Table: Failed**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| fail_date   | date |

`fail_date` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the days of failed tasks.

**Table: Succeeded**

| Column Name  | Type |
|--------------|------|
| success_date | date |

`success_date` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the days of succeeded tasks.

**Task Description**

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write a solution to report the `period_state` for each continuous interval of days in the period from `2019-01-01` to `2019-12-31`.

`period_state` is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as `start_date` and `end_date`.

Return the result table ordered by `start_date`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

Failed table:

| fail_date |
|-----------|
| 2018-12-28|
| 2018-12-29|
| 2019-01-04|
| 2019-01-05|

Succeeded table:

| success_date |
|--------------|
| 2018-12-30   |
| 2018-12-31   |
| 2019-01-01   |
| 2019-01-02   |
| 2019-01-03   |
| 2019-01-06   |

**Output:**

| period_state | start_date | end_date   |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01 | 2019-01-03 |
| failed       | 2019-01-04 | 2019-01-05 |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06 | 2019-01-06 |

**Explanation:** 
The report ignored the system state in 2018 as we care about the system in the period `2019-01-01` to `2019-12-31`.
From `2019-01-01` to `2019-01-03` all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
From `2019-01-04` to `2019-01-05` all tasks failed and the system state was "failed".
From `2019-01-06` to `2019-01-06` all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".

```sql
WITH AllDates AS (
    SELECT fail_date AS task_date, 'failed' AS period_state
    FROM Failed
    WHERE fail_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT success_date AS task_date, 'succeeded' AS period_state
    FROM Succeeded
    WHERE success_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
),
grp_date as (
    select task_date, period_state, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY task_date) - 
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY period_state ORDER BY task_date) AS grp
    from (
        select * from AllDates
    ) as temp
)
select period_state, min(task_date) as start_date, max(task_date) as end_date
from grp_date
group by period_state, grp
order by min(task_date)
```

### Find the Subtasks That Did Not Execute

**Table: Tasks**

| Column Name    | Type |
|----------------|------|
| task_id        | int  |
| subtasks_count | int  |

`task_id` is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row in this table indicates that `task_id` was divided into `subtasks_count` subtasks labeled from 1 to `subtasks_count`.
It is guaranteed that 2 <= `subtasks_count` <= 20.

**Table: Executed**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| task_id     | int  |
| subtask_id  | int  |

(`task_id`, `subtask_id`) is the combination of columns with unique values for this table.
Each row in this table indicates that for the task `task_id`, the subtask with ID `subtask_id` was executed successfully.
It is guaranteed that `subtask_id` <= `subtasks_count` for each `task_id`.

**Task Description**

Write a solution to report the IDs of the missing subtasks for each `task_id`.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

| 3       | 4              |

Executed table:

| task_id | subtask_id |
|---------|------------|
| 1       | 2          |
| 3       | 1          |
| 3       | 2          |
| 3       | 3          |
| 3       | 4          |

**Output:**

| task_id | subtask_id |
|---------|------------|
| 1       | 1          |
| 1       | 3          |
| 2       | 1          |
| 2       | 2          |

**Explanation:** 
Task 1 was divided into 3 subtasks (1, 2, 3). Only subtask 2 was executed successfully, so we include (1, 1) and (1, 3) in the answer.
Task 2 was divided into 2 subtasks (1, 2). No subtask was executed successfully, so we include (2, 1) and (2, 2) in the answer.
Task 3 was divided into 4 subtasks (1, 2, 3, 4). All of the subtasks were executed successfully.
